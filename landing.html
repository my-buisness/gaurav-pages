🌷 <b>CONGRATULATIONS U WON A BOUQUET</b><br><br>
Today is Rose Day, and everyone gives flowers like it’s a rule.<br><br>
But I didn’t want to give you something that just looks pretty for a while.<br><br>
I wanted to give you tulips.<br><br>
Because tulips don’t scream for attention.<br>
They just exist quietly. Beautiful. Confident. Soft.<br><br>
I’ll bring the bouquet myself when I come.<br>
And inside it, two crochet tulips.<br><br>
(As a symbol of my undying affection)<br><br>
One for you.<br><br>
And one for the version of me that smiled the day I realised<br>
you’re the kind of person I’d choose again and again.

From the very moment you entered my life, <br><br>
I knew my search for meaning was over.<br><br>
 Today, and every day, <br><br>
 I propose my heart to you all over again.<br><br>
 I propose to choose you, to cherish you, <br><br>
 to stand by you through every storm and sunset. <br><br>
 I propose a lifetime of laughter, <br><br>
 of deep conversations, of passionate love and gentle comfort.<br><br>
  My soul officially and forever proposes to yours <br><br>
  for an endless partnership in this beautiful journey. <br><br>
  I am yours, completely and irrevocably.

🍫 <b>CONGRATULATIONS U WON<br><br> 'CHOCOLATE OF UR CHOICE FREE WILL'</b><br><br>
Chocolate Day is about comfort.<br>
About something sweet you reach for without thinking too much.<br><br>
So this is for those moments.<br><br>
Call me when you’re bored.<br>
Call me when your day feels heavy.<br>
Call me when you don’t even know why you want to talk.<br><br>
I’ll be there.<br>
Not perfectly.<br>
Just honestly.<br><br>
Some things aren’t meant to finish quickly.<br>
And I hope I’m one of them.<br><br>


And Abt that free will just tell me which one would u like .💗💗<<3

My precious love, you are my cuddliest,<br><br>
 most cherished teddy bear,<br><br>
  the one I always want to hold close.<br><br>
Even when we're apart, thinking of you <br><br>
gives me the warmest, softest,<br><br>
 most comforting feeling inside. <br><br>
 You are my partner in cozy dreams,<br><br>
  my safe haven, and the adorable, <br><br>
  loving soul I get to call mine. <br><br>

Promise Day makes people say big things.<br>
Forever this. Always that.<br><br>
I don’t want to promise you the world.<br><br>
I want to promise you something smaller, but stronger.<br><br>
I’ll show up.<br>
I’ll be honest.<br>
I won’t disappear when things stop being exciting or easy.<br><br>
I’ll choose consistency over drama.<br>
And effort over excuses.<br><br>
Not loudly.<br>
Not perfectly.<br><br>
Just sincerely.

🤍 <b>Hug Day</b><br><br>
This coupon unlocks a very serious thing.<br><br>
A 3–4 hour hug session.<br><br>
No talking required.<br>
No explanations needed.<br>
Just closeness that says more than words ever could.<br><br>
The kind of hug where time slows down.<br>
Where worries get quieter.<br>
Where everything feels a little more okay.<br><br>
Comfort shouldn’t expire.<br>
And this one never will.

My love, today isn't about a physical touch,<br><br>
 but about the sweetness held in the very thought of you.<br><br>
It's the soft smile you inspire, <br><br>
the warmth that spreads through my chest<br><br>
when I hear your voice.<br><br>
Kiss Day, to me, is the quiet promise in your laugh,<br><br>
the tenderness in your words,<br><br>
and the beautiful closeness I feel even in our shared silence.<br><br>
You are the most lovely thought I hold,<br><br>
the most cherished feeling in my heart,<br><br>
making even the air sweeter. I celebrate the gentle,<br><br>
soul-deep affection I have for you, <br><br>
which feels more profound than any single touch ever could.

This isn’t a coupon.<br><br>
This is me standing here, emotionally exposed, and still calm about it.<br><br>
I choose you.<br><br>
I choose the way you talk.<br>
The way you exist.<br>
The way you make ordinary moments feel softer.<br><br>
Not loudly.<br>
Not dramatically.<br><br>
Just clearly.<br><br>
You’re my Valentine.<br>
I’m not asking.<br><br>
I’m telling you.
